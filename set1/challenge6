# Break repeating-key XOR

# The file 6.txt has been base64'd after being encrypted with repeating-key XOR.

# Decrypt it.

# Here's how:

#  1. Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to (say) 40.

#  2. Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance between two strings. The Hamming distance is just the number of differing bits. 
#  The distance between:
#         this is a test
#  and
#         wokka wokka!!!
# is 37. Make sure your code agrees before you proceed.

#  3. For each KEYSIZE, take the first KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the second KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and find the edit distance between them. Normalize this 
#  result by dividing by KEYSIZE.

#  4. The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably the key. You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE 
#  blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.

#  5. Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into blocks of KEYSIZE length.

#  6. Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every block, and a block that is the second byte of every block, and so on.

#  7. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have code to do this.

#  8. For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best looking histogram is the repeating-key XOR key byte for that block. Put them together and
#  you have the key.

# This code is going to turn out to be surprisingly useful later on. Breaking repeating-key XOR ("Vigenere") statistically is obviously an academic exercise, a "
# Crypto 101" thing. But more people "know how" to break it than can actually break it, and a similar technique breaks something much more important.#


# First is our edit distance/Hamming distance function
# It is used for error detection or error correction when data is transmitted over computer networks
